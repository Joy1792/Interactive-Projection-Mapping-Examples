# Interactive Projection Mapping with Processing!

This repository complements my workshop on interactive projection mapping at [Processing Community Day NYC 2019](http://processing.nyc/). In this workshop, the audience will learn how to transform a Processing sketch into an interactive projection installation. Weâ€™ll use Syphon to stream the output of a Processing sketch into projection mapping tools, learn how to map our projected sketch onto a unique surface, and make our projection installation interactive by integrating a basic sensor.

### Talk Slides
You can find the Google Presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GfVKDLk5o_yNBy4mst4nDapCcCRiyqyqsiHV5sRelnk/edit?usp=sharing).

### For Windows Users
[Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/), the technology that allows us to stream Processing outputs into our projection mapping software, is only available for Mac. For Windows computers, you can use [Spout](http://spout.zeal.co/) to achieve the same results. Similar to Syphon, it also has a [Processing library](https://github.com/leadedge/SpoutProcessing).

### Projection Mapping Software Options
During the workshop, I will use [MadMapper](https://madmapper.com/madmapper/) to provide some insight into the state-of-the-art application, but there are alternatives (including free ones). I haven't tested these options yet, but I plan to record a YouTube video reviewing some of these alternatives in the future.

Here's a growing list of open-source alternatives you might want to explore:
- [MapMap](https://mapmapteam.github.io/)
- [VPT 8](https://hcgilje.wordpress.com/vpt/)
- [Keystone](https://fh-potsdam.github.io/doing-projection-mapping/processing-keystone/)
- [Splash](https://github.com/paperManu/splash)

While not free, a few others you might want to look into are:
- [TouchDesigner](https://www.derivative.ca)
- [HeavyM](https://heavym.net/en/)
- [Resolume](https://resolume.com/)
